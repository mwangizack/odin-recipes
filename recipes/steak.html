    <h1>Tuscan Flank Steak</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A grilled steak coming off a charcoal fire, which was then sliced and splashed with olive oil, lemon, and rosemary. While I'm sure my version is far from traditional, it's really tasty and the very user-friendly flank steak is the perfect cut.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak, trimmed of excess fat</li>
        <li>⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup chopped fresh rosemary, garlic, 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth and set marinade aside.</li>
        <li>Pierce the steak with a fork 20 to 30 times. Place in a shallow baking dish. Pour marinade over steak and flip to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/3 cup olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon minced rosemary, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt in a jar. Cover and shake the dressing to combine. Shake again before using.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from marinade; scrape off any chunks of marinade. Discard used marinade. Season steak with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place steak on the preheated grill and cook until browned on the outside and red on the inside, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. Place 2 tablespoons of the olive oil-lemon juice dressing in a small bowl. 
            Use rosemary sprig to baste the steak while it cooks. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a steak should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for rare.
        </li>
        <li>Remove steak to a platter and allow to rest about 6 minutes before slicing. Cut in half lengthwise, then into 1/4-inch-thick slices at an angle against the grain. Drizzle with additional dressing.</li>
    </ol>
