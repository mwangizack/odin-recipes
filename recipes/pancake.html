    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons buckwheat flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix together white flour, buckwheat flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Pour the dry ingredients into the egg-mixture. Stir until the two mixtures are just incorporated.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or large frying pan to medium-hot, and place 1 tablespoon of butter, margarine or oil into it. Let the butter melt before spooning the batter into the frying pan, form 4 inch pancakes out of the batter.
            Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 3 minutes. Continue with this process until all of the batter has been made into pancakes.
