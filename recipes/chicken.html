    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>

        <li>
            Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). 
            Set a wire rack inside a broiler pan or baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Lift up skin gently; sprinkle salt, pepper, and garlic powder under the skin. Replace skin. 
            Season skin and underside of the thighs with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Arrange on the rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            Continue roasting until juices run clear, about 30 minutes more. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
